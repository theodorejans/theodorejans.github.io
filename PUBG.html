<h1>Player Unknown Battlegrounds</h1>
<p>Player Unknown Battlegrounds(PUBG), is a game where you are dropped onto an island with almost a hundred other people. You then have to loot gear, and try to survive to be the last person standing out of everyone. The game is high risk, high reward, you can get taken out of the game very fast, or sometimes dedicate a long time for trying to get gear and survive, to only be eliminated by jumping off too high of a building or cliff.  It is extremely rewarding when you make it to 1st place after many attempts. It even says "Winner winner chicken dinner!" when you get first place, as you can see in the picture below.
